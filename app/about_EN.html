  <h3>About the data</h3>
  <p>This app provides a user-friendly interface to download meteorological data from the Open Data Suedtirol.</p>
  <p>The Open Data Suedtirol API and its documentation can be found at the Province of Bozen web site.</p>
  <p>
  <a href="http://daten.buergernetz.bz.it/it/dataset/misure-meteo-e-idrografiche" target="_blank">Open Data Suedtirol - Meteo data web service</a>
    </p>
    <p>Once selected the stations and sensors by filtering the table and/or drawing a polygon on the map and chosen 
  a date range, you are ready to download (the dataset avaiable refers to the last three years).</p>
    <p>When download is complete, a "save" icon pops up and you can choose to save a csv or a json file. 
  You can choose between different time aggregations. "raw" preserves the timestamp of the sensor you are 
  downloading (usually 5 or 10 minutes). For the other time aggregation options you will get different statistics
  for each measurement in the selected timespan.</p>
    <p>All measurements will have a count (the sum) of No Data in the timespan selected.</p>
    <p>All measurements besides precipitation and wind direction will also have a mean value. </p>
    <p>Precipitation and Air temperature will also have the sum value.</p>
    <p>Air temperature and relative humidity will also have min and max values.</p>
    <p>Wind direction will be reclassified with the following values and the most frequent value will be displayed:</p>
    <p>1 = N; 2 = NE; 3 = E; 4 = SE; 5 = S; 6 = SW; 7 = W; 8 = NW.</p>
    <p>You can also choose between "wide" or "long" data.
  In wide data you get a column for every sensor, in long data you get a factor column called "Sensor" and a column
  "Value" which stores the measurements.</p>
